The research in Chen-Zhu Wang’s laboratory focuses on physiological and molecular aspects of insect-plant interactions and chemical communications of insects. We take the advantages of a unique research model system of two sibling species of Helicoverpa (H. armigera and H. assulta). Despite their evolutionary proximity, the two species have different host ranges. H. armigera is a generalist and H. assulta a specialist. In the light of coevolution, our goal is to better understand (1) the mechanistic basis of the interactions between plants and insects and (2) the genetic basis of female sex pheromone signals and male olfactory responses..
