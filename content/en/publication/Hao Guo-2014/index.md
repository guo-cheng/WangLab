abstract: In the present study, we identified two aldehyde reductase activities in the antennae of Helicoverpa species, NADH and NADPH‐dependent activity. We expressed one of these proteins of H.armigera, aldo‐keto reductase (AKR), which bears 56% identity to bovine aldose reductase, displays a NADPH‐dependent activity and is mainly expressed in the antennae of adults. Whole‐mount immunostaining showed that the enzyme is concentrated in the cells at the base of chemosensilla and in the nerves. The enzyme activity of H.armigeraAKR is markedly different from those of mammalian enzymes. The best substrates are linear aliphatic aldehydes of 8–10 carbon atoms, but not hydroxyaldehydes. Both pheromone components of H.armigera, which are unsaturated aldehydes of 16 carbons, are very poor substrates. Unlike mammalian AKRs, the H.armigera enzyme is weakly affected by common inhibitors and exhibits a different behaviour from the action of thiols. A model of the enzyme suggests that the four cysteines are in their reduced form, as are the seven cysteines of mammalian enzymes. The occurrence of orthologous proteins in other insect species, that do not use aldehydes as pheromones, excludes the possibility of classifying this enzyme among the pheromone‐degrading enzymes, as has been previously described in other insect species.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Chemosensory proteins (CSPs) are soluble proteins found only in arthropods. Some of them fill the lumen of chemosensilla and are believed to play a role similar to that of odorant-binding proteins in the detection of semiochemicals.
