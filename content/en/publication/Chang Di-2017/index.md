abstract: Lepidopteran caterpillars rely on olfaction and gustation to discriminate among food sources. Compared to the larval gustation, the larval olfaction has been poorly investigated. To uncover the molecular basis of olfaction in Helicoverpa armigera larvae, we identified 17 odorant receptor (Or) genes in larval antennae and maxillae using transcriptome sequencing, and functionally identified the response spectra of seven Ors to ecologically relevant odorants. Innate behavioural responses of larvae to active odorants were evaluated in chemotaxis assays. Several odorant blends were formulated based on the Ors tuning spectra and caterpillar chemotaxis. A four-component blend strongly attracted H. armigera larvae, and cis-jasmone and 1-pentanol were identified as essential components. Localization analyses showed that the two Ors detecting these components (Or41 and Or52) were expressed in the same sensory neurons. This is the first evidence that Ors in a polyphagous caterpillar respond to odorants in a combinatorial manner. The design of attractants to target specific olfactory pathways may promote the development of new baits for pest management.
