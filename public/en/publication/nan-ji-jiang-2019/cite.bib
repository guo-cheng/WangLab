	abstract = {The Oriental armyworm, Mythimna separata, has been described to emit geographic population-specific sex pheromones, with either Z11-16:Ald or Z11-16:Ac as the major component. Using a comprehensive set of electrophysiological, behavioral, and genetic analyses, we study the sex pheromone communication of M. separata in North China from pheromone receptors and antennal lobe to behavior. GC-EAD results show that Z11-16:Ald is the only compound eliciting electrophysiological responses in pheromone gland extracts. Further in vivo optical imaging studies reveal that Z11-16:Ald activates the cumulus of the MGC and show dose-dependent responses. The wind tunnel tests demonstrate that Z11-16:Ald alone is sufficient to induce the entire sequence of male sexual behaviors. Transcriptome and q-PCR results show that MsepOR3 is specifically and abundantly expressed in male antennae. By using the Xenopus oocytes and two-electrode voltage-clamp recording, we finally validate that the oocytes expressing MsepOR3/ORco gave dose dependent responses to Z11-16:Ald. We suggest single Z11-16:Ald could be used for monitoring the population of M. separata in North China.},
