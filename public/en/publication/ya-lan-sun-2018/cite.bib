	abstract = {Parasitic wasps rely on olfaction to locate their hosts in complex chemical environments. Odorant receptors (ORs) function together with well-conserved odorant coreceptors (ORcos) to determine the sensitivity and specificity of olfactory reception. Campoletis chlorideae (Hymenoptera: Ichneunmonidae) is a solitary larval endoparasitoid of the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera, and some other noctuid species. To understand the molecular basis of C. chlorideae’s olfactory reception, we sequenced the transcriptome of adult male and female heads (including antennae) and identified 211 OR transcripts, with 95 being putatively full length. The tissue expression profiles, as assessed by reverse-transcription PCR, showed that seven ORs were expressed only or more highly in female antennae. Their functions were analysed using the Xenopu slaevis oocyte expression system and two-electrode voltage-clamp recordings. CchlOR62 was tuned to cis-jasmone, which was attractive to female C. chlorideae adults and H. armigera larvae in the subsequent behavioural assays. Further bioassays using caged plants showed that the parasitism rate of H. armigera larvae by C. chlorideae on cis-jasmone-treated tobacco plants was higher than on the control plants. Thus, cis-jasmone appears to be an important infochemical involved in the interactions of plants, H. armigera and C. chlorideae, and CchlOR62 mediates the attractiveness of cis-jasmone to C. chlorideae.},
